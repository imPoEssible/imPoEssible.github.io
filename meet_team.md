## Members and Personal Learning Goals

###Devynn
For this project, I hope to use my experience with CAD and mechanical design to produce an elegant real-world system. I am focusing on the mechanical design of the project. I want to get more experience building the machines I design and designing outside of a vacuum, taking into consideration the restrictions of electrical and software systems when CADing and being able to compensate for them when I can.

###TJ
I am a member of the Class of 2018, planning to major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. In this project, I am working on the electrical and website development of the project. I want to expand on the coding I know by especially working with html and jeckyll in this project, as well as hone my knowledge about electrical systems.

###William 
I’m majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering, so for this project, I want to gain experience in the EE side of things. I don’t have a firm definition for what that means, but I will be satisfied as long as I don’t become a person whose only job is to add wires to things. I also want to integrate with mechanical and will definitely work on some software if needed.
