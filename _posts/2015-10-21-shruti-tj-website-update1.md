title: Basic Website Setup!
---

Today we accomplished setting up a website using Jekyll. We took a basic template and edited the content and added new tabs. We are going to explore more features and make the website look more polished in the future! We implemented Markdown, HTML, and ruby so far to build our website. Stay tuned for improvements!
