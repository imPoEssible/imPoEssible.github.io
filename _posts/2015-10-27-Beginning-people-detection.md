title: Beginning people detection
---

Since our last meeting, we had decided to go with a desktop companion PoE project with two modes of interaction. Idle mode would run the majority of the time when there is no one in the area, while interaction mode would be activated when a person entered the interaction range of the project.

To accomplish that, we'd need to be able to detect people somehow. My first instinct is to use the the capabilities of the kinect NiTE library for people detection.

Unfortunately, all of this code is written in C++. Which means I'll be doing a lot of learning these next couple of days.
